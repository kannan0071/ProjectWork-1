## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Developed an intelligent system designed to assist in the meticulous task of identifying and categorizing chromosomes within the context of karyotyping, an essential process in the field of genetics and medical diagnosis. To accomplish this, we harnessed the power of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework, a sophisticated tool commonly used in computer vision. Our approach involved training the system to recognize and classify individual chromosomes by showing it numerous images containing these genetic structures. This system offers several significant advantages. First, it operates swiftly, significantly reducing the time required for chromosome analysis. Second, it excels in accuracy, minimizing errors that can occur during manual analysis.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
*  Fast Processing: YOLOv8 offers real-time detection, speeding up chromosome analysis.

*  High Accuracy: It ensures precise detection and classification of individual chromosomes.

*  End-to-End Efficiency: Detects and classifies chromosomes in one step, streamlining the process.
  
*  Flexible and Scalable: Easily adaptable to different chromosome datasets and applications.


## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
